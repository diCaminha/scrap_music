The lord named Adam and Eve, 
to live a happy life. 
In the garden of Eden, 
but they disobeyed. 

I wanna know, 
why they sin, 
in the garden of Eden. 

It`s a devil mental affair, 
in the shape of a serpent. 

And they broke the fruit of life 
and everyone of us is living in sin. 

Any anywhere you go,

I noticed that no one tabbed this song, and it's one of my favourites.
For the second part, you'll need to listen to the song to get the exact

Notes
This album recorded durring the Wailers 1978 world
tour features the guitar sytlings of three great guitarists,
On one hand this album is filled with difficult bass/guitar
riff sycopation that almost defies transcription.  On the other
hand the general chord progression of many of the songs are quite
simple.  What follows are the chords played by Bob throughout the
songs.  Some songs only have one or two guitar chords, however
due to the sycopated riffs of the lead guitars the songs stay
musicallly interesting.

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair

My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say:

G                         D
Welcome to the Hotel California

Any time of year... you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the captain, ""Please bring me my wine,"" he said
""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place...such a lovely face
Livin it up at the Hotel California
Any time of the year...any time of the year

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice, and she said,
""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device""
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
""Relax"" said the nightman, ""We are programmed to receive""
""You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave""

Welcome to the Hotel California

Than the colour of his eyes;  me say war.
